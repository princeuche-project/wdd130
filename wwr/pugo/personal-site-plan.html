        <h2>The concept</h2>
        <p>
            Recognizing that the market for quality shoes in extended sizes is quite competitive using the
            larger shoe retailers,
            <strong>PUGO</strong> clothing and shoe boutique will minimize the competition by targeting
            specific niches, generally
            focusing on other retail stores whose prices are too expensive, lack quality and are not “shoe
            and clothe size efficient”.
            <em>PUGO</em> clothing and shoe boutique has three keys to success. The first is establishing a
            high quality, high value
            relationship with its vendors and customers. The second key is to ensure reliable and timely
            delivery of their products.
            The last key to success is reliable administration of the organization. This boutique business
            plan is intended to
            provide the structure to make sure this last key to success is realized.

        </p>
        <h3>The Market</h3>
    <p>
        PUGO clothing and shoe boutique will grow at 3% and there are many potential customers now,
        patiently awaiting the start
        of business. PUGO clothing and shoe boutique will differ from other retail clothing and shoe
        stores because we will always
        be less expensive than the competition, but we will still maintain the high quality of our
        shoes.
        
        <p><strong>Also, we will offer a sales promotion on a monthly basis, such as:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy one, get one half price</li>
                <li>Buy one, get one free half off on shoes from the previous season</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                PUGO clothing and shoe boutique Naira (for every N50,000 purchase, the consumer receives an
                additional 20% off of their
                next purchase)
                In the future, PUGO clothing and shoe boutique will design its own, custom-made shoes and
                clothes for women, men
                and children.
